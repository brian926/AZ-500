Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks **prevent**, **detect**, **investigate**, and **respond** to advanced threats.

Defender for Endpoint uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:
- **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big data, device learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.
- **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data.

**Core Defender Vulnerability Management**
Built-in core vulnerability management capabilities use a modern risk-based approach to the discovery, assessment, prioritization, and remediation of endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

**Attack surface reduction**
The attack surface reduction set of capabilities provides the first line of defense in the stack. By ensuring configuration settings are properly set and exploit mitigation techniques are applied, the capabilities resist attacks and exploitation. This set of capabilities also includes network protection and web protection, which regulate access to malicious IP addresses, domains, and URLs.

**Next-generation protection**
To further reinforce the security perimeter of your network, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses next-generation protection designed to catch all types of emerging threats.

**Endpoint detection and response**
Endpoint detection and response capabilities are put in place to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats that may have made it past the first two security pillars. Advanced hunting provides a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you proactively find breaches and create custom detections.

**Automated investigation and remediation**
In conjunction with being able to quickly respond to advanced attacks, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint offers automatic investigation and remediation capabilities that help reduce the volume of alerts in minutes at scale.

**Microsoft Secure Score for Devices**
Defender for Endpoint includes Microsoft Secure Score for Devices to help you dynamically assess the security state of your enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve the overall security of your organization.

**Microsoft Threat Experts**
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's new managed threat hunting service provides proactive hunting, prioritization, and additional context and insights that further empower Security operation centers (SOCs) to identify and respond to threats quickly and accurately.

Defender for Endpoint directly integrates with various Microsoft solutions, including:
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Intune
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Office
- Skype for Business

## Define a Privileged Access Device Strategy
To ensure the most secure conditions for your company to you need to ensure security from the time of purchase of a new device, to its first usage, and beyond. Zero Trust, means that you don't purchase from generic retailers but only supply hardware from an authorized OEM that support Autopilot.

For this solution, root of trust will be deployed using Windows Autopilot technology with hardware that meets the modern technical requirements. To secure a workstation, Autopilot lets you leverage Microsoft OEM-optimized Windows 10 devices. These devices come in a known good state from the manufacturer. Instead of reimaging a potentially insecure device, Autopilot can transform a Windows 10 device into a “business-ready” state. It applies settings and policies, installs apps, and even changes the edition of Windows 10.
![[Pasted image 20231012103311.png]]

To have a secured workstation you need to make sure the following security technologies are included on the device:
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0
- BitLocker Drive Encryption
- UEFI Secure Boot
- Drivers and Firmware Distributed through Windows Update
- Virtualization and HVCI Enabled
- Drivers and Apps HVCI-Ready
- Windows Hello
- DMA I/O Protection
- System Guard
- Modern Standby

Levels of Device Security

|**Device Type**|**Common usage scenario**|**Permitted activities**|**Security guidance**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Enterprise Device|Home users, small business users, general purpose developers, and enterprise|Run any application, browse any website|Anti-malware and virus protection and policy based security posture for the enterprise.|
|Specialized Device|Specialized or secure enterprise users|Run approved applications, but cannot install apps. Email and web browsing allowed. No admin controls|No self administration of device, no application installation, policy based security, and endpoint management|
|Privileged Device|Extremely sensitive roles|IT Operations|No local admins, no productivity tools, locked down browsing. PAW device|

This chart shows the level of device security controls based on how the device will be used.
![[Pasted image 20231012103438.png]]

A secure workstation requires it be part of an end-to-end approach including device security, account security, and security policies applied to the device at all times. Here are some common security measures you should consider implementing based on the users' needs. Using a device with security measures directly aligned to the security needs of it users is the more secure solution.

|**Security Control**|**Enterprise Device**|**Specialized Device**|**Privileged Device**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) managed|Yes|Yes|Yes|

## Deploy privileged access workstations
Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) provide a dedicated system for sensitive tasks that is protected from Internet attacks and threat vectors. Separating these sensitive tasks and accounts from the daily use workstations and devices provides very strong protection from phishing attacks, application and OS vulnerabilities, various impersonation attacks, and credential theft attacks such as keystroke logging, Pass-the-Hash, and Pass-The-Ticket.

PAW is a hardened and locked down workstation designed to provide high security assurances for sensitive accounts and tasks. PAWs are recommended for administration of identity systems, cloud services, and private cloud fabric as well as sensitive business functions. In order to provide the greatest security, PAWs should always run the most up-to-date and secure operating system available: Microsoft strongly recommends Windows 10 Enterprise, which includes several additional security features not available in other editions (in particular, Credential Guard and Device Guard).

The PAW security controls are focused on mitigating high impact and high probability risks of compromise. These include mitigating attacks on the environment and risks that can decrease the effectiveness of PAW controls over time:
- **Internet attacks** - Isolating the PAW from the open internet is a key element to ensuring the PAW is not compromised.
- **Usability risk** - If a PAW is too difficult to use for daily tasks, administrators will be motivated to create workarounds to make their jobs easier.
- **Environment risks** - Minimizing the use of management tools and accounts that have access to the PAWs to secure and monitor these specialized workstations.
- **Supply chain tampering** - Taking a few key actions can mitigate critical attack vectors that are readily available to attackers. This includes validating the integrity of all installation media (Clean Source Principle) and using a trusted and reputable supplier for hardware and software.
- **Physical attacks** - Because PAWs can be physically mobile and used outside of physically secure facilities, they must be protected against attacks that leverage unauthorized physical access to the computer.

Separate "channel" for administration (a highly sensitive task) that is created by maintaining separate dedicated administrative accounts and workstations is an architectural approach built on the protections found in the Windows 10 Credential Guard and Device Guard features.

This methodology is appropriate for accounts with access to high value assets:
- **Administrative Privileges** - PAWs provide increased security for high impact IT administrative roles and tasks. This architecture can be applied to administration of many types of systems including Active Directory Domains and Forests, Microsoft Azure Active Directory tenants, Microsoft 365 tenants, Process Control Networks (PCN), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), and Point of Sale (PoS) devices.
- **High Sensitivity Information workers** - The approach used in a PAW can also provide protection for highly sensitive information worker tasks and personnel such as those involving pre-announcement Merger and Acquisition activity, pre-release financial reports, organizational social media presence, executive communications, unpatented trade secrets, sensitive research, or other proprietary or sensitive data. This guidance does not discuss the configuration of these information worker scenarios in depth or include this scenario in the technical instructions.

Securing privileged access is a critical first step to establishing security assurances for business assets in a modern organization.

Administrative "Jump Box" architectures set up a small number administrative console servers and restrict personnel to using them for administrative tasks. This is typically based on remote desktop services, a 3rd-party presentation virtualization solution, or a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology.

This approach is frequently proposed to mitigate risk to administration and does provide some security assurances, but the jump box approach by itself is vulnerable to certain attacks because it violates the **clean source** principle. The clean source principle requires all security dependencies to be as trustworthy as the object being secured.

The administrative session on the jump server relies on the integrity of the local computer accessing it. If this computer is a user workstation subject to phishing attacks and other internet-based attack vectors, then the administrative session is also subject to those risks.

While some advanced security controls like multifactor authentication can increase the difficulty of an attacker taking over this administrative session from the user workstation, no security feature can fully protect against technical attacks when an attacker has administrative access of the source computer (e.g. injecting illicit commands into a legitimate session, hijacking legitimate processes, and so on.)

The default configuration in this PAW guidance installs administrative tools on the PAW, but a jump server architecture can also be added if required.

## Configure Update Management
With Update Management, you can assess your update status across your environment and manage your Windows Server and Linux server updates from a single location—for both your on-premises and Azure environments.

Computers that Update Management manages use the following configurations to perform assessment and update deployments:
- Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) for Windows or Linux
- Desired State Configuration (DSC) in Windows PowerShell for Linux
- Hybrid Runbook Worker in Azure Automation
- Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for Windows computers

Azure Automation uses runbooks to install updates. You can't view these runbooks, and they don’t require any configuration. When an update deployment is created, it creates a schedule that starts a master update runbook at the specified time for the included computers. The master runbook starts a child runbook on each agent to install the required updates.

The following diagram is a conceptual depiction of the behavior and data flow together with how the solution assesses and applies security updates to all connected Windows Server and Linux computers in a workspace.
![[Pasted image 20231012104715.png]]

You can use the Update Management solution to manage updates and patches for your Windows and Linux virtual machines. From your Azure Automation account, you can:
- Onboard virtual machines
- Assess the status of available updates
- Schedule installation of required updates
- Review deployment results to verify that updates were applied successfully to all virtual machines for which Update Management is enabled

The Log Analytics agent for Windows and Linux needs to be installed on the VMs that are running on your corporate network or other cloud environment in order to enable them with Update Management.

After you enable Update Management for your machines, you can view machine information by selecting **Computers**. You can view information about machine name, compliance status, environment, OS type, critical and security updates installed, other updates installed, and update agent readiness for your computers.

## Deploy Disk Encryption
**Azure Disk Encryption for Windows VMs** helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. It uses the BitLocker feature of Windows to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs), and is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets.

**Supported VMs**
Windows VMs are available in a range of sizes. Azure Disk Encryption is supported on Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs. Azure Disk Encryption is also available for VMs with premium storage.
Azure Disk Encryption is not available on Basic, A-series VMs, or on virtual machines with less than 2 GB of memory.

**Supported operating systems**
- Windows client: Windows 8 and later.
- Windows Server: Windows Server 2008 R2 and later.
- Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session.

To enable Azure Disk Encryption, the VMs must meet the following network endpoint configuration requirements:
- To get a token to connect to your key vault, the Windows VM must be able to connect to an Azure Active Directory endpoint, [login.microsoftonline.com].
- To write the encryption keys to your key vault, the Windows VM must be able to connect to the key vault endpoint.
- The Windows VM must be able to connect to an Azure storage endpoint that hosts the Azure extension repository and an Azure storage account that hosts the VHD files.
- If your security policy limits access from Azure VMs to the Internet, you can resolve the preceding URI and configure a specific rule to allow outbound connectivity to the IPs.

Azure Disk Encryption uses the BitLocker external key protector for Windows VMs. For domain joined VMs, don't push any group policies that enforce TPM protectors.

BitLocker policy on domain joined virtual machines with custom group policy must include the following setting: Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information -> Allow 256-bit recovery key. Azure Disk Encryption will fail when custom group policy settings for BitLocker are incompatible. On machines that didn't have the correct policy setting, apply the new policy, force the new policy to update (gpupdate.exe /force), and then restarting may be required.

Azure Disk Encryption will fail if domain level group policy blocks the AES-CBC algorithm, which is used by BitLocker.

Azure Disk Encryption requires an Azure Key Vault to control and manage disk encryption keys and secrets. Your key vault and VMs must reside in the same Azure region and subscription.

Azure Disk Encryption uses the DM-Crypt feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) and is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets.

**Supported VMs**
Linux VMs are available in a range of sizes. Azure Disk Encryption is supported on Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs. Azure Disk Encryption is also available for VMs with premium storage.

**Note:** Azure Disk Encryption is not available on Basic, A-series VMs, or on virtual machines that do not meet these minimum memory requirements:

|**Virtual machine**|**Minimum memory requirement**|
|---|---|
|Linux VMs when only encrypting data volumes|2 GB|
|Linux VMs when encrypting both data and OS volumes, and where the root (/) file system usage is 4GB or less|8 GB|
|Linux VMs when encrypting both data and OS volumes, and where the root (/) file system usage is greater than 4GB|The root file system usage * 2. For instance, a 16 GB of root file system usage requires at least 32GB of RAM|

Once the OS disk encryption process is complete on Linux virtual machines, the VM can be configured to run with less memory.

Azure Disk Encryption requires the dm-crypt and `vfat` modules to be present on the system. Removing or disabling `vfat` from the default image will prevent the system from reading the key volume and obtaining the key needed to unlock the disks on subsequent reboots. System hardening steps that remove the `vfat` module from the system are not compatible with Azure Disk Encryption

## Managed Disk Encryption Options
There are several types of encryption available for your managed disks, including Azure Disk Encryption (ADE), Server-Side Encryption (SSE), and encryption at the host.
- Azure Disk Encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet organizational security and compliance commitments. ADE encrypts the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) inside your VMs by using the device mapper DM-Crypt feature of Linux or the BitLocker feature of Windows. Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets.
- Azure Disk Storage Server-Side Encryption (also referred to as encryption-at-rest or Azure Storage encryption) automatically encrypts data stored on Azure-managed disks (OS and data disks) when persisting on the Storage Clusters. When configured with a Disk Encryption Set (DES), it supports customer-managed keys as well.
- Encryption at the host ensures that data stored on the VM host hosting your VM is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage clusters.
- Confidential disk encryption binds disk encryption keys to the virtual machine's TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and makes the protected disk content accessible only to the VM. The TPM and VM guest state is always encrypted in attested code using keys released by a secure protocol that bypasses the hypervisor and host operating system. Currently only available for the OS disk. Encryption at the host may be used for other disks on a Confidential VM in addition to Confidential Disk Encryption.

Encryption is part of a layered approach to security and should be used with other recommendations to secure Virtual Machines and their disks.

The following is a comparison of **Storage Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**, **Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)**, **encryption at the host**, and **Confidential disk encryption**.

## Deploy and Configure Windows Defender
Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016 include key security features. They are Windows Defender Credential Guard, Windows Defender Device Guard, and Windows Defender Application Control.

Introduced in Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows Server 2016, Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security enhancement to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets might lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or pass-the-ticket attacks. Windows Defender Credential Guard helps prevent these attacks by helping protect Integrated Windows Authentication (NTLM) password hashes, Kerberos authentication ticket-granting tickets, and credentials that applications store as domain credentials.

By enabling Windows Defender Credential Guard, you get the following features and solutions:
- Hardware security enhancement. NTLM, Kerberos, and Credential Manager take advantage of platform security features, including Secure Boot and virtualization, to help protect credentials.
- Virtualization-based security enhancement. NTLM-derived credentials, Kerberos-derived credentials, and other secrets run in a protected environment that is isolated from the running operating system.
- Better protection against advanced persistent threats. When virtualization-based security enhancement helps protect Credential Manager domain credentials, NTLM-derived credentials, and Kerberos-derived credentials, the credential theft attack techniques and tools that many targeted attacks use are blocked. Malware running in the OS with administrative privileges can’t extract secrets that virtualization-based security helps protect. Although Windows Defender Credential Guard provides powerful mitigation, persistent threat attacks will likely shift to new attack techniques, so you should also incorporate Windows Defender Device Guard and other security strategies and architectures.

Application control is a crucial line of defense for helping protect enterprises given today’s threat landscape, and it has an inherent advantage over traditional antivirus solutions. Specifically, application control moves away from the traditional application trust model, in which all applications are assumed trustworthy by default, to one where applications must earn trust to run. Many organizations understand this and frequently cite application control as one of the most effective means for addressing the threat of malware based on executable files (such as .exe and .dll files).

Windows Defender Application Control helps mitigate these types of threats by restricting the applications that users can run and the code that runs in the system core, or kernel. Policies in Windows Defender Application Control also block unsigned scripts and MSIs, and Windows PowerShell runs in Constrained language mode.
